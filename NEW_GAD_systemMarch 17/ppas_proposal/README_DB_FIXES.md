# Database Structure Fixes

This document provides information about database structure fixes that have been applied to resolve issues with the GAD proposal system.

## Issue: "Unknown column 'created_at' in 'field list'"

If you encounter this error when saving a GAD proposal, it means there's a mismatch between the SQL queries and the actual database structure.

### Solution

1. Run the database fix script:
   ```
   php fix_db_issues.php
   ```

   This script will update the structure of the following tables:
   - `gad_proposal_activities`
   - `gad_proposal_personnel`
   - `gad_proposals`

   It ensures that the `created_at` column is properly defined in all tables.

2. If you still encounter issues, verify the database structure:
   ```
   php check_table.php
   ```

   This will display the current structure of all relevant tables.

## Recent Changes

The following changes were made to address the "Unknown column 'created_at'" error:

1. Modified SQL query in `save_gad_proposal.php` to ensure it uses the correct column format.
2. Added the `fix_db_issues.php` script to update all tables if needed.
3. Provided a `check_table.php` script to verify table structures.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any database-related issues:

1. Run `php check_table.php` to verify the structure of all tables.
2. Run `php fix_db_issues.php` to fix any structural issues.
3. Check the SQL queries in `save_gad_proposal.php` to ensure they match the actual database structure.

For persistent issues, consider consulting the database administrator or the developer who implemented these fixes.
